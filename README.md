This repository contains a collection of beginner-level assembly language programs written for the Netwide Assembler (NASM). The programs are designed to help newcomers understand fundamental concepts of low-level programming, including basic input/output, arithmetic operations, and data manipulation.

Contents
The repository is organized into folders, with each one corresponding to a specific programming assignment or topic.

Addition: Programs demonstrating integer addition.
